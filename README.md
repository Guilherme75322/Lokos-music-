Rapid import works instantly with public repositories.
Combine the Replit import URL with your GitHub repository URL to start the import process.

<Accordion title="Import using rapid import" defaultOpen={true}>
  1. Copy the repository GitHub URL, starting with `github.com`.

  2. Type `https://replit.new/` in the browser address bar and paste your copied GitHub URL at the end (no spaces).

     **Example**:

     GitHub repository URL: `https://github.com/exampleUser/my-app`

     Import URL: `https://replit.new/github.com/exampleUser/my-app`

  3. Press Enter to start the automatic import process.

## Guided import

Guided import steps you through the process of selecting a repository to import
and supports public and private repositories.

<Accordion title="Import using guided import" defaultOpen={false}>
  1. Navigate to <a href="https://replit.com/" target="_blank">[https://replit.com](https://replit.com)</a>.

  2. Select <img class="icon-svg" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/shared/buttons/create-app-icon.svg" /> **Create App** from the left dock.

  5. Paste the complete GitHub repository URL in the text field.
     If the import tool can read the repository at the URL, it displays the repository description. Otherwise, it displays an error message.

     The following screenshot shows an example of the repository preview:
